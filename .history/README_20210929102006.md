# Preparation to Run the Manuscript Code

## Tech Stack

1) Python 3.8+
2) TensorFlow v2.5+
3) Install packages listed in the ``` requirements.txt ``` file.
<hr>

##  Installation requirements
<hr>

- After cloning the repository, change to the main folder

       cd ~/apin-fs-paper/apin-fs/

where ``` ~ ``` represents the home directory.

- Install the Packages listed the ``` requirements.txt ``` file as follows

      pip install -r requirements.txt


In case you decide to install the contents of the requirements manually (in situations where there are issues regarding version conflicts), install each package individually. For example, <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" target="_blank">TensorFlow .2.0 from the Website</a>

### Recommended Packages for Running Code
<hr>


Use either the  Anaconda Python 3.7+ or the venv provided in Python to create a new environment. Details can be found here and also on this Website. From the <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/packages/py3.9_win-64/" target="_blank"> Anaconda Website </a> and the ``` venv ``` is contained in Python.
### Instructions on how run the code:


1) Change to the source code directory containing the main training file.
<hr>


- Change to the folder containing the code

      cd ~/apin-fs-paper/apin-fs/src/models

Assuming the correct versions of all packages in the requirements file have been installed, run the following code to train the model

     python train_model.py
